    m_Localized: 221 days, 16 hours and 35 minutes have passed since I recieved my
      mission... Almost like it has falled from the sky directly into my mind. I
      can see it with a terrifying clear view but it feels real... And that is the
      problem. I am the only one who can see it. But I don't care. No one can stop
      me or will stop me ever. Even if I don't sleep every single night, they will
      not take it away. They will not catch me. I am better than them, better than
      everyone else.

      This is a new invention for programmers, it has
      artificial intelligence where the user only completes words given and auto-completes
      the code while it''s doing so. This gives more productivity to the user while
      programing. At the start the program will give you programming words to later
      give out random letters to check the type of project you want to complete.


      Steps
      to use the program:

      1. Check the word you have to copy.

      2. Copy
      the word into the imput field.

      3. Press "Enter" and the program will
      give you feedback.

      4. R E P E A T.'
